pip install httpx asyncio
```

If you encounter any errors, try:
```bash
python -m pip install httpx asyncio
```

### Step 3: Prepare Your Credentials File
Create a text file named `data.txt` in the same folder as the script with your credentials:
```
username1:password1
username2:password2
```

## üîß Usage

```bash
python hit.py
```

## ‚ùì Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'httpx'"**
   - Solution: Run the command: `pip install httpx`

2. **"FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'data.txt'"**
   - Solution: Make sure you've created the data.txt file in the same folder as hit.py

3. **"ValueError: not enough values to unpack"**
   - Solution: Check your data.txt file format. Each line must be in the format username:password

4. **Script crashes or freezes**
   - Solution: Check your internet connection. The script needs internet access to connect to the servers.
